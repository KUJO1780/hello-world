Hello! Im pretty green to programming and am attempting to utalize Python to create analytics for my job in procurement. I've taken a few intro programming classes in Python and Java, but had to shift my focus away from programming for the last year so I have some catching up to do. Im an avid woodworker, outdoorsman, pc gamer, an excel power user, and a fledgling data analyst. Looking forward to expanding my horizons by learning to code!
